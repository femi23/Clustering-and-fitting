This analysis uses clustering and fitting
techniques to understand how climate
change factors impact economic prosperity
and sustainable development of countries.
We grouped countries based on factors such
as GDP per capita, CO2 emissions, CO2
production per head, and Renewable energy
consumption, and compared the results from
1990 and 2015 to understand how the
clusterâ€™s characteristics changed over time.
